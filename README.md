# Welcome to WaterQualityWithVernier - part of my C# Code Louisville final project. I created this program to help Koi pond enthusiasts have a way to track some important pond water data, such as water temperature, turbidity, pH and dissolved oxygen. These metrics are very imporant when it comes to health of your fish and overal maintenance of your pond. This program tests user input and notifies user if the data that they entered is within safe levels for their fish. All entered data is searchable by date and is neatly presented in a table that can be found within "Data Analysis" section for each experiment. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach me at erminky@gmail.com. 


Features that were used to satisfy C# Code Louisville requirements are:

1. Implemented a "master loop" - user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions including choosing to exit the program.

2. Created a list (CSV format) that populates with user input and retrieves data on search by date. 

3. Reads data from an external file (CSV in this case) and uses that data in application.

4. Retrieves user input data from CSV file and displays it in a table.
